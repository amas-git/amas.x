DESCRIPTION:

Sock it to me, baby! Far out! Groovy! 1967, man. The Summer of Love, Haight-Ashbury, sit-ins, love-ins, and, on more sober note, a lot of acid. Psychodelia was in full swing, but my memories only peripherally include all that hippie crap. We lived in one of the Bay Area bedroom communities; Dad's job took him into Berkeley every weekday; I started kindergarten that year. Over the next several years my young and impressionable eyes beheld many strange and sometimes wonderful things. Many Saturdays were spent with my father as he haunted the used book stores; days filled the smell of old print, hippie sitings, and ice cream sundaes at Fenton's in Oakland. Before I wax more nostalgic about the sixties (did I mention the white Ford station wagon with tailfins?), suffice it to say that SIXTYSEVEN is a new font inspired by a style of lettering popular back then, but more specifically by a particular typeface known variously as Daisies, Floralies, Flower Child, etc., that's big, bold, and beautiful, with lots of little daisies and flowers, especially in the counters of most characters. I set out to approximate a thin, much less flamboyant derivation (without the flowers) by producing the font you have now obviously acquired. SIXTYSEVEN sets well at small or large point sizes. There isn't any difference between upper- and lower-case characters, and punctuation consists only of: period, comma, exclamation mark, question mark, ampersand, singlequote/apostrophe. Yep, this font is worth every penny you paid for it. As a bonus, there is a full number set (0-9), and I've included a few groovy dingbats (see if you can find them).
